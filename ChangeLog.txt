       Full details with examples:
         http://x5software.com/chunk/examples/ChunkExample?example=net

v2.1.2 - Fixed bug in addData(capsule, "x")

v2.1.1 - Fixed bug with boxed primitive wrapper objects
         like Double, Character, Integer etc.

v2.1 - New {$tag|filter(#x_template)} runs the #x_template snippet as
         a macro, binding {$x} to the value of {$tag}
       Easier access to POJO attributes and bean properties:
         * chunk.setToBean('my_thing', someObject)
             copies someObject's public accessor properties to a Map
         so the template can do this:
                {$my_thing.price}
             to get the value of
                someObject.getPrice()
         * chunk.set('item', somePOJO)
             copies somePOJO's non-private attributes to a Map
         so the template can do this:
                {$item.price}
             to get the value of
                somePOJO.price
         * Map values seen by template renderer are a snapshot from
       time of first attribute access.

v2.0 - Refactored for 20% speed gain.
       New |type filter {$what_am_i|type} outputs one of the following:
         STRING LIST OBJECT CHUNK NULL
       Improved support for objects (ie associative arrays)
         {% exec #template @json %} now preserves JSON object key order.
         {% loop in $obj as $key:$val %} now loops through the attributes
           of an associative array (aka Map/Object)
         {$obj} now visible from inside loops/chunks, not just {$obj.attr}
         Loop can now resolve object/list references like $x = "{$y}"
       Theme can now be configured to not route errors to output,
       and/or print errors to STDERR or another PrintWriter.
         theme.setErrorHandling(false, System.err);
       Fixed bug with backticks and new {$syntax`$num`}
       The |escapexml filter has been refactored to be more efficient,
         now handles upper-page unicode escapes.
       Fixed bug in translate filter.

v1.9 - Minor enhancements to {% loop %} tag, several minor bugfixes.
        Updating to the latest version is strongly recommended.

v1.8 - Major syntax change: new {$tag} and {.command} syntax
        replaces older, unfriendly syntax: {~tag} and {^command}
        Not to worry, library remains back-compatible.

       Other changes:
         * {% exec %} Macro enhancements
           - xml attributes now avail as {$elt_name@attr_name}
           - introduced @inline keyword in {% exec %} syntax
               eg: {% exec @inline xml %} means, check {% body %}...{% endbody %}
               block for template, and args will be in xml format.
         * Some new text filters
           - {$tag|onempty(N/A)} outputs N/A in null *and* empty-string case
           - {$tag|unescape} unescapes xml-entities.

v1.7 - New features:
         * New built-in filters |get(x) and |alternate(even_output,odd_output)
         * Better support for lists and trees (ie nested maps) of data.
         * New {% loop %} options counter_tags="true" and array_index_tags="true"
            default for both options is now false.
         * Macro invocation overhaul.  New syntax:
              {% exec MACRO %} ... params ... {% endexec %}
           With option to provide params json-formatted** or xml-formatted:
              {% exec MACRO @json %}
               { x : 3,
                 a : 'some-string',
                 list : ['a','b','c'] }
              {% endexec %}
           And an inline template body marker a la:
              {% exec %} ...params... {% body %} ... {% endexec %}
            ** json-smart library is required for parsing json.
         * Several minor bugfixes.

v1.6 - Major refactor for speed.
         * Chunk can now write to stream.
            Use chunk.render( out ) instead of chunk.toString()
         * Templates are now pre-compiled for big performance gain.
         * Users may now register contributed filters without modifying
            the chunk source code.  See online docs for example.

v1.5 - New features:
         * Localization: mark a string for translation in your template
             with clean _[one two three] syntax.
           Create a translations file /locale/xx_XX/translate.csv in the
             classpath with lines like:
             "one two three","un deux trois"
           Then, wnen you set up your Theme, call theme.setLocale("xx_XX")
             and all toString() output will get sent through the translator.
         * Localized strings support sprintf format directive %s
           Provide args like so: {_[Acct # %s balance is %s],$account,$balance}
         * Translate filter: dynamic output can also be translated via the
             "_" filter like so: {$any_tag|_}
             or more verbosely, {$any_tag|translate} or {$any_tag|xlate}
         * UTF-8 support: all templates are now assumed to be UTF-8.
           Use system property -Dchunk.template.charset=... to override.
         * Improved examples to better demonstrate features.

v1.4 -   * Fixed glaring if-else block conditional bug.
         * Now easier to instantiate Theme object.  Just put your themes
           in src/themes/*.chtml and use the no-arg Theme() constructor
           and you're good to go.  Deploying in a jar?  Just include the
           themes folder in your jar and the template engine will find them.

v1.3 - New features:
         * Nestable {% if %}...{% endif %} and {% loop %}...{% endloop %}
             constructs
         * Cleaner {% include file %} {% include #snippet %} include syntax
         * Cleaner {% loop in $data as $d %} loop syntax
         * Better comment-stripping (removes any whitespace-only lines left
             after stripping the comment).
         * Even smarter about finding theme files.  Just put a folder named
             "themes" directly under your project's src folder.  As long as
             it gets exported to classpath (alongside your classes that
             import and use Chunk), your templates will get found.
         * JUnit test suite.  Bout time.
         * New indent(n) filter indents tag output by n spaces.
         * New HEX filter -- shorthand for {$x|hex|uc}

v1.2 - New features:
         * Literal blocks w/ {% literal %} no interpolation
         * Dynamic tags with backticks {$pkg_`$pkg_id`}
         * getSnippet(templateRef) now returns Snippet obj
             - use fetch(templateRef) to get tpl as string.
         * Chunk can now find and use templates that are packaged
           inside a jar on the classpath.
         * nodata="" now supported by {% loop %} tag.
         * xml,xmlesc,xmlescape now synonyms for htmlescape filter.
         * implemented perl case-conv regex directives via hack:
              s/.*/\U$0/ now working (but {$tag|uc} is still quicker)

v1.1 - Java source code missing from initial release, fixed.
     - Handles missing jeplite jar more gracefully.

v1.0 - Initial release
     - Add optional jeplite jar to classpath (from jeplite.sourceforge.net)
       to enable |calc filter and {.calc()} special tag - math expressions.
